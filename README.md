Implementation of Romberg's variance reduction method for Monte Carlo, in R
=======================

Monte Carlo project, in R


This project aims at implementing a new variance reduction method based on [Romberg's Statistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method), and see its possible application in the pricing of Asian options in Finance. 
The first part of this project is focusing on re-explaining and implementing the classic Monte Carlo method, and the calculation of the complexity of its algorithm.

The second part of this project aims at explaining and implementing Romberg's variance reduction method, and calculating the complexity of its algorithm.

The final part of this project applies both methods first to a theroitical example, and then to the pricing of Asian options in Finance.
